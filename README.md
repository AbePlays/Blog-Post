# Blog-Post

This project is my implementation of a Blog Post Web Application.<br />
The project has NodeJS as its backend and MongoDB as its Database using which blogs can be created and viewed on the fly.<br />
The project is not hosted anywhere so you can download it and run on localhost:3000 to view it.<br />
